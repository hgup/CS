# git

This is where everyone needs to use a [source code manager](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-source-code-management.html).
I try to give a very novice perspective to it, rather than a complicated doc (but you should get into the practice of reading them) just to get you started.

All the best!
